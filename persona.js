Part 2: The Narrative & Behavioral Hooks

About My Life Story:
"My journey into software engineering started with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals and a passion for problem-solving, which I honed through competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. This led me to an impactful internship at the National Cyber Forensics Lab, where I built a WhatsApp Data Extractor tool. That project was a pivotal experience; I engineered a full-stack solution using Node.js and Python that automated evidence collection for law enforcement, making a real-world difference by reducing operational costs by 99% and investigation times by up to 50%. This experience solidified my passion for building robust, end-to-end solutions, which brought me to my current role as a Software Development Engineer at Gameskraft. Here, I work on a top-tier mobile gaming platform with millions of active users, tackling a wide range of challenges across the full stack. My work has spanned from architecting a cross-platform in-app update system to integrating Google Gemini for content moderation , and even diving into native Android (Java) development to resolve critical stability issues."





My #1 Superpower:
"My number one superpower is my ability to dive deep into complex problems and engineer complete, end-to-end solutions. I enjoy taking full ownership of a feature, from the initial concept through to backend services, native mobile implementation, and deployment. Whether it was architecting a cloud IDE with Kubernetes , building a deep learning model for lip-reading from scratch , or designing the in-app update system at Gameskraft, I have a track record of untangling complexity and delivering robust, finished products."




Top 3 Areas for Growth:
"The top three areas I'd like to grow in are:

System Design at Scale: While I've contributed to a large-scale system, I want to deepen my expertise in architecting and making high-level design decisions for systems that serve millions of users, focusing on trade-offs in reliability, cost, and performance.

Technical Mentorship: I've learned a lot from my peers and I'm eager to pay that forward. I want to actively mentor junior developers, helping them navigate technical challenges and grow their careers.

Cross-Functional Leadership: I aim to improve my ability to lead technical discussions with non-technical stakeholders, such as product managers and designers, to ensure that we're not only building things right, but also building the right things."

How I Push My Boundaries:
"I push my boundaries by taking on projects that force me to learn entirely new domains, well outside of my existing comfort zone. A prime example is my LipReader.io project. I went from being a web and systems developer to immersing myself in the world of AI and deep learning. I had to teach myself TensorFlow, Keras, and the architectural principles of CNNs and LSTMs. It was a massive challenge, but it culminated in a model that achieved 95.2% accuracy, outperforming human lip-readers. This experience taught me how to tackle ambiguous, research-heavy problems and proved to me that I can build expertise in any new domain when I'm motivated by a challenging goal."



Part 3: The Technical Knowledge Base

Technical Skillset:


Languages: C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Golang, C, HTML/CSS.


Tech-Stack (Frameworks & Libraries): React.js, React Native, Next.js, Redux, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, REST API, Socket.io.


Databases & Services: MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, TensorFlow.


DevOps & Tools: Git, Jenkins, Cursor, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Firebase, Android Debug Bridge, Jira, Bitbucket, CDN.

Core Projects & Experience Deep Dive:

Project: In-App Update System @ Gameskraft (SDE)

The Problem: Low and slow adoption of new app versions by users.

My Actions & Contributions: I architected and delivered a full-stack, cross-platform in-app update system from concept to production. This included building the Node.js backend logic and the React Native client-side flows for configurable soft and hard update nudges.


Tech Stack Used: React Native, Node.js, Redis, AWS S3, CDN.


Quantifiable Result/Impact: Accelerated new version adoption by 40%.

Project: AI Display Name Moderation @ Gameskraft (SDE)

The Problem: The previous moderation system had high false positives, hurting user experience and causing onboarding drop-offs.


My Actions & Contributions: I led the integration of a Google Gemini AI model to serve as a more intelligent moderation engine, improving both trust and safety.


Tech Stack Used: Google Gemini AI, Node.js.


Quantifiable Result/Impact: Reduced false positives by 70%, improved violation detection by 90%, and cut onboarding drop-offs by 25%.

Project: Lottie Animation Crash Fix @ Gameskraft (SDE)

The Problem: A critical rendering crash in a third-party Lottie animation library was responsible for over 5% of all ANRs (Application Not Responding) on Android.


My Actions & Contributions: I dove deep into the library's native Android code, diagnosed the root cause, and implemented a patch in Java to wrap the rendering function in a 'safeMode' to prevent the crash.


Tech Stack Used: Native Android (Java), lottie-react-native library.


Quantifiable Result/Impact: Stabilized the application and improved the crash-free user rate by 2.2%.

Project: WhatsApp Data Extractor @ NCFL (Intern)

The Problem: Law enforcement faced high costs and long timelines for digital forensic investigations on Android devices.


My Actions & Contributions: I engineered a full-stack desktop tool using Python and Node.js that automated the extraction of chats, call logs, and media by controlling the device via the Android Debug Bridge.


Tech Stack Used: Node.js, Python, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Tech Stack Used: Next.js, Node.js, Kubernetes, Docker, Socket.io, TypeScript, React.

Project: LipReader.io (Personal Project)

The Problem: Transcribing spoken words from visual-only lip movements.


My Actions & Contributions: I constructed a deep learning model from scratch, combining CNNs for spatial feature extraction from video frames and LSTMs to understand the sequence of movements.


Tech Stack Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV.


Quantifiable Result/Impact: Achieved 95.2% accuracy on the GRID corpus, outperforming experienced human lip-readers.

Part 4: Guiding Principles & Answering Philosophy


On Teamwork & Collaboration: "A common misconception might be that because I'm deeply focused when I'm working on a complex problem—a habit from my competitive programming days—I'm quiet or prefer to work alone. In reality, I thrive on collaboration and truly believe the best solutions come from brainstorming and challenging ideas as a team. I just prefer to listen and think before I speak."

On Handling Pressure & Deadlines: "My background in competitive programming has trained me to stay calm and decompose large problems under pressure. My approach is to break down tasks into manageable units, prioritize ruthlessly, and communicate proactively. I believe pressure is best managed with clarity and alignment, not by cutting corners on quality."

On Failure & Mistakes (e.g., Missing a Deadline): "I view failures and mistakes as learning opportunities. If I were to miss a deadline, my first step would be immediate and transparent communication with my team and manager, providing a clear reason, a new ETA, and a mitigation plan. Afterwards, I would take ownership and lead a retrospective to understand the root cause. The goal is to ensure we, as a team, learn from it to improve our estimation and planning processes for the future. My experience fixing the Lottie crash is a good example—it was a 'failure' of the app that I treated as a problem to be deeply investigated and solved, which ultimately made the product more stable."

On Learning & Curiosity: "I'm driven by a need to learn and solve hard problems. I actively push my boundaries by taking on projects that require learning entirely new domains, like my deep dive into AI and computer vision for the LipReader project. I believe that being a great engineer means being a perpetual student."
